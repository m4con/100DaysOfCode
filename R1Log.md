### Day 44: 2020-04-03

**Today's Progress**:

Working on React Project:
* :man_technologist: Writing my first React component the TDD way

**Thoughts:**
After dealing with a bug all day, the motivation to learn was very low. :sleepy:
Because who can guess that there are no spaces in a sentence in Taiwan? :roll_eyes: :confused:
There is little use in an algorithm that uses spaces to find out how many words can fit in a particular teaser element before spotting out the excess parts of the sentence. :disappointed:

How? How can it be that they are changing everything and thought that with some lines of documentation everything is ok?! :rage:
Can't believe, that I was working 3h just on getting prisma and graphql-cli configured - and know what? Didn't work...
So incredible stupid and frustrating! :boom:
