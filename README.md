* [ ] complete a D3js project
* [ ] develop a project bootstrapper based on nodejs
* [ ] web accessibility
* [ ] level up in functional programming via codewars

## Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

### Main Commitment
I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

_Start date: 2020-02-20_

_End date: 2020-06-08_

### Additional Rules

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. Everything code related counts. Reading books, docs and articles as well as listen to podcasts and going to coding meetups. And of course coding ifself!
4. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5. I will update the [Logfile](https://github.com/m4con/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/R1Log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
6. My health is my top priority. So for whatever reason I might need a break, I will take it. (I try to not take more than three days off in a row, but in the end I will listen to my body/ mind, if it needs to recharge).
